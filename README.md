# WIM Skin - Flat Panel #

This is a skin for World of Warcraft addon WIM (WoW Instant Messenger). This
addon merely adds a visual skin for the addon and does not function without the
addon itself. For more information about WIM, see: http://www.wimaddon.com

## Installation ##

To install, simply install this like any other WoW interface addon and then
change the settings in your WIM to use the skin.

Step by step install instructions: 

1. Copy the folder to your WoW\Interface\Addons folder
2. In WoW, go to Wim Options -> Display Settings -> Window Skin -> Flat Panel

Done! This will cause WIM to use the flat panel in chat windows instead.
